## `Introduction`

I bootstrapped this react project with create-react-app, for the backend I am using express. To run both my client and my server I am using concurrently to proxy my requests.

## `Getting Started`

You want to first npm i in the root directory and then run yarn dev and this will start both the server and the client.
